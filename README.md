# Ionic4-Side-Menu-as-a-Component---Example
Ionic 4 example of a side menu as a component

Moving the side menu of an Ionic 4 app to a separate component has many potential benefits, including separation of code, easier maintenenace of the menu, and easier creation of multiple and conditional menus.

The trick to moving a side menu from app.component.ts to a separate component is to move the entire ion-split-pane to the component. Moving just the menu to a component will not work.

This repo demonstrates this technique.
